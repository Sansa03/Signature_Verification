The Signature Authentication System is a secure solution for verifying user identities based on handwritten signatures. It collects a userâ€™s
 name and signature image, captured via a mobile note-taking app, and stores the data in an Excel sheet as a reference database. 
During authentication, users provide their name and upload a new signature image, which is compared with stored data using advanced 
techniques such as AlexNet for feature extraction, OpenCV for image processing, and cosine similarity for precise matching. The system 
displays the results in an HTML table, indicating either "Authentication Successful" or "Authentication Failed," depending on the outcome.
This project offers a reliable and efficient method for signature-based verification, making it suitable for secure database access and 
identity verification applications.
